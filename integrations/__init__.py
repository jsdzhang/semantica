Semantica Framework Integrations

Optional integration packages for agentic frameworks (Google ADK, Claude Agent SDK, Agno, etc.).
Each integration is self-contained, independently installable via extras_require, and maintains
zero impact on core Semantica - keeping the semantic layer lean while maximizing ecosystem reach.
